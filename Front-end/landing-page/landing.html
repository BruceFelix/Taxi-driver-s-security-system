                <h2>Driver safety tips</h2>
                <p>We build our technology with your safety in mind. But actions you might take can also help protect yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>1.Staying focused on driving</h3>
                <p>
                    You can help keep roads safe by staying alert, keeping your eyes on the road, and resting when needed to prevent drowsy driving. 
                    Remember: texting while driving is illegal in most states and countries. Some drivers use a mount to position their phone in a 
                    place where they can easily see it, to help reduce dangerous distractions. In some cities, laws require them.
                </p>

            <div class="safety">
                <h3>2. Encouraging back-seat riders</h3>
                <p>
                    You can consider inviting riders who are traveling solo to sit in the back seat. This allows them to safely exit from either 
                    side of the vehicle to avoid traffic and also gives you both some personal space. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>3.Buckle up</h3>
                <p>In many places, seat belt use is required by law, for both drivers and riders. It’s also the most effective way to save lives and reduce injuries related to car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>4.Watching for pedestrians and cyclists</h3>
                <p>
                    General rules of the road say to be on the lookout for people who are walking and biking. This is especially important when you’re pulling over for a dropoff or pickup, and when you're driving at night.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>5.Keeping your dropoffs legal</h3>
                <p>Knowing local laws about where you can drop off riders can help when you encounter loading zones, parked vehicles, and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>6.Follow your intuition</h3>
                <p>Trust your instincts and experience and use your best judgment when driving with Uber. If you ever feel you're in an emergency situation, you can get urgent help by using the emergency button in your app. And remember, if you feel unsafe you can end the ride at any time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety">
                <h3>7.Being Kind and respectful</h3>
                <p>
                  Treat each and everyone of your customers and pedestrians respectful.
